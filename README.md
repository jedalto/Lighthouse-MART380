This environment features a lighthouse prominently placed upon an ocean isle. This island is a 3D environment built in Unity using the Universal Render Pipeline (URP). This project explores environmental storytelling, shader development, and stylized aesthetics and was part of a project for improving world-building and atmosphere design. The lighthouse was made from scratch in Blender, the textures of the grass and sand created in Krita, and the ocean water shader developed in Unity. /n
